PutMask & PutEmoji for encoding and decoding video and audio use from Gstreamer library

"GStreamer is a plugin-based framework licensed under the LGPL."

So because of this license, we want to show you how you can use specific Gstreamer library beside PutMask & PutEmoji
First download PutMask from Google Play Store

https://www.wikihow.com/Download-an-APK-File-from-the-Google-Play-Store

we only support arm64-v8a and armeabi-v7a model

Second, you need to decode apk file with Apktool

https://ibotpeaches.github.io/Apktool/documentation/

replace your desired version of Gstreamer with "libgstreamer_android.so"



you can here find how to build your desired version of Gstreamer
 
https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/documentation/tutorials/android/index.html?gi-language=c

OR

https://github.com/servo/libgstreamer_android_gen

and
 then build the apk file with Apktool and sign it and use it!




We owe it to the open-source community and we will turn PutMask into an open-source project soon.

But before that, if you want to access the code or have any other suggestions, contact this email developers_support@putmask.com
